                    <h3>-Nutritional Information:</h3>
                   <p> -Caloric Content: High in calories due to the significant amount of ghee and sugar.</p>
                   <p> -Rich in Fat: The ghee provides a rich source of fat.</p>
                    <p>-Source of Protein: The gram flour adds some protein content.</p>

            <h2> Malabar Parotta</h2> 
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <p>Flour: All-purpose flour (maida) is typically used.</p>
            <p>Water: For kneading the dough.</p>
            <p>Oil/Ghee: Used in the dough and for cooking.</p>
            <p>Salt: For seasoning.</p>
            <p>Sugar: Sometimes added to the dough for a slight sweetness and to help with browning.</p>
            <h3>Preparation:</h3>
            <p>Dough Preparation: The flour is mixed with water, a little oil, salt, and sometimes sugar to form a soft, pliable dough.</p>
            <p>Resting the Dough: The dough is allowed to rest for a few hours, which helps in gluten development, making it elastic and easier to stretch.</p>
            <p>Dividing and Rolling: The dough is divided into small balls. Each ball is then rolled out into a thin sheet.</p>
            <p>Layering: The thin sheet is stretched further, oiled, and folded into a pleated structure. The pleated dough is then rolled into a spiral.</p>
            <p>Final Rolling: The spiraled dough is flattened into a disc again.</p>
            <p>Cooking: The flattened dough is cooked on a hot griddle (tawa) with oil or ghee until golden brown and cooked through. It is cooked on both sides, often pressing it gently to ensure even cooking.</p>
            <h3>Serving:</h3>
            <p>Malabar Parotta is typically served hot and is often enjoyed with a variety of accompaniments, including:</p>

            <p>Curries: Such as chicken curry, beef curry, mutton curry, or vegetable kurma.</p>
            <p>Gravy Dishes: Any rich, spicy gravy pairs well.</p>
            <p>Yogurt or Raita: For a cooling contrast.</p>

            <h3>Characteristics:</h3>
            <p>Layered Texture: The parotta is known for its flaky, layered texture which is achieved through the unique folding and rolling technique.</p>
            <p>Crispy Outside, Soft Inside: When cooked properly, the parotta should have a crispy exterior with a soft, chewy interior.</p>
            <p>Rich and Buttery: The use of oil or ghee gives it a rich, buttery flavor.</p>
